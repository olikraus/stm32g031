  Default clock is HSI16 (16 MHz)
  Blink with busy delay.
    
  Ensure that -DUSER_VECT_TAB_ADDRESS is set during compilation, otherwise
  interrupts will not work after the "go" commant of the flashware USART upload.
  
  Problem is, that SCB->VTOR doesn't point to FLASH_BASE, so manually
  assigning SCB->VTOR = FLASH_BASE;	will also fix this.

  If -DUSER_VECT_TAB_ADDRESS is defined, then the SCB->VTOR is set in
  SystemInit(void) which is called by the reset handler (.s file).
