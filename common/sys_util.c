    PLL VCO Programming:
      fVCO = fPLLIN Ã— (N / M)
      fPLLP = fVCO / P          I2S and ADC clock sources
      fPLLQ = fVCO / Q          High speed clock for TIM1
      fPLLR = fVCO / R          Used for the system clock

      Sideconditions:
        Valid ranges: N=8..86, M=1..8 P=2..32 Q=2..8 R=2..8
        fVCO = 64..344 MHz
        fPLLIN / M = 2.66..16MHz
      To drive TIM1 with 128MHz we need fPLLQ at 128MHz, which means fVCO >= 256 MHz
      With M=2: fPLLIN / M = 8MHz
      for fVCO=256MHz, N must be 32
      
      ADC max asyic clock is 122MHz
      For this we could use M=3, N=45 --> fVCO=240MHz --> with P=2 --> fPLLP=120MHz --> Sysclk=60MHz
      or:  M=4, N=61 --> fVCO=244MHz --> with P=2 --> fPLLP=122MHz --> Sysclk=61MHz
